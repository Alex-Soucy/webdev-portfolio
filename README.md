# webdev-portfolio

## Description

The Purpose of this project is to build myself an online portfolio for potential employers to see. This is the beginning stages of the page, it stills needs quite a bit of polishing and improvements once I learn more.

### Build and Design
* Built using HTML and CSS.
* HTML elements are semantic and in order.
* Comments are included in index.html and stylesheet.css files to help distinguish each section.
* Nav links at top of page are working to bring you to each section of the page.
* Project link images included to open a new tab to each respective page.
* CSS file organized to follow the semantic structure.
* Responsive web design elements still needed.
