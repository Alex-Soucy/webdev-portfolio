            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Alex and I have always had a passion for technology. Video games have been a part of my life since I was young and I have always had a strong curiosity of what really made them work. I have developed skills on the hardware side building myself as well as some friends high-end PCs. Digging into coding and what makes the internet run has been a very fun challenge which I am very excited to pursue further.
            </p> <br />
            <p>
                Leadership is a trait I have developed throughout my adult life. As a student in the fire academy I was chosen as a platoon leader due to the motivation, accountability, and teamwork I displayed. Of the 15 years I spent working in restaurants, 9 of them were spent in a management role. I deal with the pressure of leadership well and find it rewarding helping other people grow and advance through their careers.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Outside of work and school I consider myself a jack of all trades and master of none. I have played sports all of my life, mainly football and baseball when I was younger and I still like to stay active with golf, softball, and snowboarding. Music is another large part of my life, I have played drums since I was 14 and generally always have music on no matter what I am doing. Opposite of being active I also spend a good amount of free time gaming and also currently teaching myself the art of video editing.
